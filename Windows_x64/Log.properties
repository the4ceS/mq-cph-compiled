Log.desc=\
A proxy to output to stdout or stderr.  There are currently no extensions to support\n\
external logging, though this could be easily added.  There are 5 levels (0-4) of\n\
verbosity defined as (NONE, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, VERBOSE).

vo.dflt = 4
vo.desc = Verbosity below which goes to stdout.
vo.type = java.lang.Integer
vo.xtra = The default is such that everything goes to stdout.

ve.dflt = 0
ve.desc = Verbosity below which goes to stderr.
ve.type = java.lang.Integer
ve.xtra = The default is such that nothing goes to stderr.
ve.hide = true
